# ABSTRACT
The upsurge in the volume of unwanted emails called spam has created an intense need for the
development of more dependable and robust antispam filters. Machine learning methods of recent
are being used to successfully detect and filter spam emails. We present a systematic review of
some of the popular machine learning based email spam filtering approaches. Our review covers
survey of the important concepts, attempts, efficiency, and the research trend in spam filtering.
The preliminary discussion in the study background examines the applications of machine learning
techniques to the email spam filtering process of the leading internet service providers (ISPs) like
Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook emails spam filters. Discussion on general email spam filtering
process, and the various efforts by different researchers in combating spam through the use
machine learning techniques was done. Our review compares the strengths and drawbacks of
existing machine learning approaches and the open research problems in spam filtering. We
recommended deep leaning and deep adversarial learning as the future techniques that can
effectively handle the menace of spam emails.
# INTRODUCTION
Emails are important because they creates a fast, reliable form of communication that is free and easily accessible. They allow people to foster long-lasting, long-distance communication .
Spam e-mails can be not only annoying but also dangerous to customers.Spam e-mails can be defined as   
 - Anonymity
 - Mass-Mailing
 - Unsolicited

Spam e-mail messages are randomly sent to multiple addresses by all sort of groups , but mainly by lazy advertisers and criminals who wish to lead you to phishing sites. 
# How Spam and Normal e-mails look like?

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
I have chosen this project because nowadays there are lots of people trying to fool you just by sending you fake e-mails like you have won a 1000 dollars, this much amount is deposited in your account once you open this link and then they will try to hack your information.
 - Unwanted emails irritating internet consumers.
 - Critical e-mail messages are missed and/or delayed.
 - Identity Theft.
 - Spam can crash mail servers and fill up hard drive.
 - Billions of dollars lost worldwide.
# OBJECTIVE
The objective of identification of spam e-mails are :
 - To give knowledge to the user about the fake e-mails and relevant e-mails.
 - To classify that mail is spam or not.
# LITERATURE REVIEW
 - I referred  the paper S. Sharmin and Z. Zaman, "Spam Detection in Social Media Employing Machine Learning Tool for Text Mining," 2017 13th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS), Jaipur, 2017, pp. 137-142.
 - Spam prevention is often neglected , although some simple measures can dramatically reduce the amount of spam that reaches your mail box.
 - Before they send you spam , spammers obviously first need to obtain your e-mail address , which they can do through different routes.
